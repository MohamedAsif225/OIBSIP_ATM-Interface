OIBSIP-"ATM_INTERFACE" TASK-3 : 
This project is about creating a simple ATM interface. When the system starts up, users are presented with the choice to either register as a new user or log in using a valid user ID and PIN. It's all about providing a straightforward way for users to manage their accounts securely. Whether they're new to the system or returning customers, they can easily access their accounts and perform transactions. Building this interface involves ensuring that users can register securely and that their login credentials are authenticated properly. It's a fundamental yet crucial step in creating a user-friendly and reliable ATM experience.
